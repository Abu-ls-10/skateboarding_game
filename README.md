# Skateboarding Game

## Overview

The **Skateboarding Game** is a Java-based game that simulates the excitement of skateboarding through a city scene. Players collect coins while avoiding various obstacles and can perform tricks like ollies, kickflips, and treflips. Inspired by popular games such as Braille Skateboarding and Skate 3, this interactive and fun game is designed primarily for kids and teens looking for a quick gaming experience during their breaks.

## Goals

1. **User Input**: The game primarily relies on user input from keyboard keys to control gameplay.
2. **Loops**: For smooth animations, the game utilizes `for` and `while` loops to keep actions running under specific conditions.
3. **Conditionals**: Conditional statements determine game events based on player actions.
4. **Randomization**: Coins and obstacles are randomly placed throughout the game for a dynamic experience.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The code is organized into classes and methods to maintain clarity and efficiency.
6. **Storing Data**: Usernames and their highest scores are saved in a text file to enhance competitiveness.

## Specifications

- **Resolution**: The game runs at a resolution of 900 x 720, ensuring an optimal user experience without overloading system resources.
- **Graphics Library**: The game uses either JFrame for the graphical user interface.
- **Frame Rate**: Maintained between 30 and 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.
- **Class Structure**: The game includes `Skateboard`, `Coin`, and `Obstacle` classes for enhanced functionality and organization.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented during file operations to manage user data effectively.
- **Documentation**: Code includes detailed comments for clarity and navigation.

## Milestones

1. **Main Menu**: Development of a user-friendly main menu for starting, quitting, and pausing the game.
2. **Background Animation**: Creating a dynamic city road background to simulate movement.
3. **Object Creation**: Implementing the skateboard, coins, and obstacles with appropriate placement and functionality.

## How to Play

1. **User Input**:
   - Press the **right key** to move the skateboard forward.
   - Press the **left key** to move the skateboard backward.
   - Collect coins to increase your score.
   - Avoid obstacles to prevent game over.

2. **Game Flow**:
   - Enter your username to start.
   - The game will run until the player crashes into an obstacle or chooses to quit.
   - Scores will be saved for future reference.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout the development of the Skateboarding Game, I encountered various challenges, particularly with implementing a GUI in Java, as it was my first experience. I learned the importance of spending time on foundational knowledge, like JFrame, to tackle performance indicators effectively. 

Incorporating core Java concepts such as arrays and OOP programming was a significant success. However, if I were to do this project again, I would opt for a modular approach to manage the complexity of Java GUIs better.
